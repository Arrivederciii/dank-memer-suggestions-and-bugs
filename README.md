# Feature requests and bug reports for Dank Memer and it's services
This is the repo to post your feature requests, and report bugs for Dank Memer.

Rules:
 - No shitposts, this isn't the place for that
 - Make sure your bug or feature isn't already listed, repeats are annoying
 - No witch hunting or being toxic to others
 - This is not a rule breaking report form
 - Behave with civility and common sense

It is very likely your bug/request doesn't get responded to for long amounts of time, that's okay. We see it, just might not have anything to say at first.
